# data-extractor
A simple tool to extract the `Data.rsdk`'s from S1/S2 2013. Just drop your apk file on to `main.bat` and a `Data.rsdk` will appear in the data extractor directory. From there, you are given the choice to unpack your `Data.rsdk` if you want to use mods. This isn't nessecary, but it's recomended.

Batch file made by me, retrun was made by Giuseppe Gatta, Xeeynamo, and Valleybell.
